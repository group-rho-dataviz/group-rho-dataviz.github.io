The CAMEO (Conflict and Mediation Event Observations) system is the backbone of GDELT. 
It is organized hierarchically into four major "QuadClasses."

I. VERBAL COOPERATION (Neutral to Positive)
These are words, statements, and meetings. They represent normal diplomatic relations.

01 - MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENT: The most common code. "He said," "She announced." Totally neutral.

Includes: Statements of policy, comments, factual reporting.

Relevance: Exclude for conflict analysis. This is background noise.

02 - APPEAL: Asking for something politely.

Includes: "Call for peace," "Ask for aid," "Request meeting."

Relevance: Usually positive or neutral.

03 - EXPRESS INTENT TO COOPERATE: Offering to help.

Includes: "Promise to sign treaty," "Offer to mediate."

04 - CONSULT: Meetings.

Includes: "Visit," "Host a summit," "Meet with."

Relevance: Shows diplomatic activity, but not conflict.

05 - ENGAGE IN DIPLOMATIC COOPERATION: Actions that support the relationship (symbolic).

Includes: "Sign treaty," "Apologize," "Ratify agreement."

II. MATERIAL COOPERATION (Positive Action)
These are physical acts of help and giving.

06 - ENGAGE IN MATERIAL COOPERATION: Sharing resources.

Includes: "Share intelligence," "Economic trade deals."

07 - PROVIDE AID: Giving money or goods.

Includes: "Humanitarian aid," "Military aid," "Grant asylum."

08 - YIELD: Giving in to a demand (Surrender/Concession).

09 - INVESTIGATE: Fact-finding.

Includes: "Inspect weapons," "Investigate crime."

III. VERBAL CONFLICT (Negative Words / Tension)
These codes represent "Political Instability" and "Diplomatic Crises." They are precursors to violence but are not violence itself.

10 - DEMAND: Ordering someone to do something.

Includes: "Demand reform," "Order troops out."

11 - DISAPPROVE: Verbal criticism.

Includes: "Condemn," "Criticize," "Denounce," "Veto."

Relevance: High volume of this means diplomatic tension.

12 - REJECT: Refusing a request.

Includes: "Reject proposal," "Refuse to sign," "Defy law."

13 - THREATEN: Promising future harm. (Important Pre-Conflict Indicator)

Includes: "Threaten sanctions," "Threaten to attack," "Ultimatum."

Relevance: The step just before war.

14 - PROTEST: Civilian unrest. (INCLUDE for Social Conflict)

Includes: "Demonstrate," "Rally," "Hunger strike," "Strike/Boycott."

Note: Code 145 is "Violent Protest" (Riots).

IV. MATERIAL CONFLICT (Violence / War)
These are the codes for physical use of force. For your "Deaths" and "War" analysis, you MUST focus on these.

15 - EXHIBIT FORCE POSTURE: Military movement (Intimidation).

Includes: "Mobilize troops," "Military exercise," "Put police on alert."
