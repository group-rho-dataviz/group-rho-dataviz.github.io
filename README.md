# Final Project for the Data Visualization Course - Data-Driven Storytelling Website - Group Rho (Stefano Passaggio, Fabrizio Sardo)

## Important

The provided website serves as a mockup and does not represent the final web page.

## The Proposal

Our proposal is to explore how different conflicts around the world are covered by the media.
In particular we would like to see the differences between medias from different countries and the type of conflict they focus on.
In this section we would use a choropleth map or a proportional symbol map to see the most talked about countries by events and number of mentions.
We would like to conclude this section using a waffle chart visualizing the percentage the more talked about countries occupy in the total news.

We think it could be interesting to have a clustered bar chart that shows the number of events of a certain region of the world with respect to the media coverage of such region (potentially even the number of deaths caused of these events).

Then, we would like to bring concrete examples of less covered conflicts and to explore them using bar charts and line charts to show the effects of these conflicts on the population.

In the following section we would like to understand if there is something in common between these conflicts and if there are any differences. We think that an histogram or a box plot could be ideal.

The last section is dedicated to our takeaways and conclusions and it gives a more global view on the problem.

## Data Sources

The GDELT and the ACLED datasets could be useful for this project.
