## Important

The provided website serves as a mockup and does not represent the final web page.

## The Proposal

Our proposal is to explore how different conflicts around the world are covered by the media.
In particular, we would like to examine the differences between media outlets from different countries and the types of conflicts they focus on.
In this section, we would use a choropleth map or a proportional symbol map to show the most discussed countries based on the number of events and mentions.
We would like to conclude this section with a waffle chart visualizing the percentage that the most discussed countries represent in total news coverage.

We believe it could be interesting to include a clustered bar chart showing the number of events in a given region of the world in relation to the media coverage of that region (potentially also including the number of deaths caused by these events).

Next, we would like to present concrete examples of underreported conflicts and explore them using bar charts and line charts to illustrate their effects on the population.

In the following section, we aim to identify whether these conflicts share common characteristics and to highlight any differences between them. We believe that a histogram or a box plot could be particularly suitable for this purpose.

The final section is dedicated to our takeaways and conclusions and provides a more global perspective on the issue.

## Data Sources

The GDELT and ACLED datasets could be useful for this project.
